# Skill: App Release

## Description
Drives a **release** of this app. Publishing is fully automated: running the
**Release** workflow (manual dispatch on `main`) validates the version, runs
the CI checks (incl. image build + scans), pushes the image to Docker Hub
(`:version` + `:latest`) and creates the git tag + GitHub Release. It
**never deploys** — Vercel deploys run through the **Deploy** workflow
(manual) or the `deploy-manifest` orchestrator.

## When to Use
- A change is ready to ship as a new deployed version.
- You need to redeploy an already-released version (use the **Deploy**
  workflow instead — no version bump needed).

## Preconditions
- For image publishing: var `DOCKER_USERNAME` + secret `DOCKER_TOKEN`
  (Publish Image is skipped without them — release still tags).
- For deploys later: secret `VERCEL_TOKEN` + vars `VERCEL_ORG_ID`,
  `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`, `DEPLOY_ENVIRONMENTS` — see README *One-time setup*.
- Working tree green (`build-and-test` skill) before bumping.

---

## Step 1: Decide the version bump
- **Patch** (`x.y.+1`): fixes, dependency patches, docs.
- **Minor** (`x.+1.0`): backwards-compatible features/screens.
- **Major** (`+1.0.0`): contract-breaking changes — coordinate consumers.

Confirm the target version with the user.

## Step 2: Bump version
Edit `version` in `package.json` (and `CHANGELOG.md`). In the same change,
update `AGENTS.md`/`README` version references so docs stay in sync.

## Step 3: Build, test
`npm ci && npm run build && npm run lint` must be green. Optionally verify
the image build: `docker build -t test .`.

## Step 4: Commit & merge
```bash
git commit -m "<description>"
# PR → development → merge, then PR development → main → merge
```
`version` in `package.json` must already hold the release version on `main`.

## Step 5: Run the Release workflow
- Actions → **Release** → *Run workflow* on `main`. It validates the version
  (`--kind app`: fails if not on `main`, tag exists or SNAPSHOT), runs CI,
  publishes the image and creates the tag + GitHub Release.
  **It never deploys.**

## Step 6: Deploy
- Actions → **Deploy** → `version` + `environment` (`pro`/`cert`/`pre` —
  must be in `DEPLOY_ENVIRONMENTS`, default `["pro"]`), or bump the
  component tag in `deploy-manifest` and let the orchestrator deploy.
- Without `VERCEL_TOKEN`/`VERCEL_ORG_ID` the deploy job is skipped; on the
  first deploy `ensure-vercel-project.sh` creates the Vercel project and
  fills `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` automatically.

## Step 7: Verify
- Image: `docker.io/<DOCKER_USERNAME>/<repo>:<version>` on Docker Hub.
- GitHub Release/tag `<version>` created.
- Vercel deployment URL in the deploy job summary; hit `/api/health` and
  load `/` in a browser.
